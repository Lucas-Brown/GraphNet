# GraphNet
Probabilistic Graph Network with timestep for iterative processing of data.  
The nondeterministic approach makes this network ill-suited for world modelling, but ideal for agents. 
This project is highly speculative and underdeveloped as I continue to learn more about the mathematics required to train this network.
